# Contributing Guidelines

This project is open to contributions in form of issues, discussions and pull requests.

## Discussions

Create a new thread under [discussions](https://github.com/flyingcakes85/cpp-rush-book/discussions/) to start a new discussions. Do this when

- wanting to suggest changes
- requesting content/topics
- before starting to work on a major addition
- any other major change that is not urgent

## Proof Reading

You can contribute by proofreading existing chapters. [Click here](https://github.com/flyingcakes85/cpp-rush-book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22proof+read%22) to filter out proof reading issues. Add a comment on an issue if it has not been assigned already. When you are done, create a pull request with your proposed changes and remove the todo bot comment from end of chapter.

## Issues

For any urgent change - like fixing incorrect info - create an issue. Limit non urgent stuff in the discussion tab. This will let me prioritize changes.

## Pull Request

You may create pull request for minor changes without prior discussion. For any change that brings major additions/deletions discuss it first on the discussions tab or issues tab depending on urgency.

As a rule of thumb, any suggestion that may have conflicting views should go in duscussions tab. Topics related to errors or inconsistencies should go in issues tab.
